/**
 * The dogfood corpus runner: the PACKAGED agent against real repositories, in observation mode.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY EARLIER REPLAY. Previous benchmarking ran the engine out of
 * this repository's own source tree. That measures the engine. It does not measure the product, and
 * the packaging exercise that produced the agent found four defects that source-tree runs could never
 * have surfaced - a missing shebang, an install that dirtied the observed worktree, unparseable
 * generated YAML, and a guard that silently checked nothing. So this harness installs the exact
 * `npm pack` tarball into a clean prefix and executes THAT binary. It never imports src/client.
 *
 *     private source -> build -> npm pack -> exact .tgz -> clean install -> real repository
 *
 * OBSERVATION ONLY. Nothing here skips, selects, or influences any test run. It records what DiffCI
 * WOULD have chosen. Falsifying those choices requires actually executing the full suite and checking
 * whether any failure falls outside the proposed selection - that is a separate, much slower pass, and
 * deliberately not conflated with this one.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run dogfood -- --repo <path-or-owner/name> [--commits 20] [--out corpus.jsonl]
 *   npm run dogfood -- --corpus scripts/dogfood-corpus.json
