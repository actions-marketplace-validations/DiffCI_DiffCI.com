# DiffCI Agent Example: Node

This example shows the files `diffci init` adds to a Node repository so AI coding agents use DiffCI
as their default CI/CD validation lens.

```bash
npx "@diffci.com/diffci@latest" init --workflow
npx "@diffci.com/diffci@latest" check
```

DiffCI is observation-only by default and does not replace required CI.
