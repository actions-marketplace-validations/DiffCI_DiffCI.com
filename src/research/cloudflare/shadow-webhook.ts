/**
 * Stage 2 GitHub App webhook receiver (2026-08-21) - the event-driven observation source the
 * architecture doc designed ("github-app-webhook") and the App registration
 * (docs/github-app-registration.md) now makes real. Decision logic only, dependency-injected and
 * unit-testable in plain Node (tests/research/cloudflare/shadow-webhook.test.ts) - the same split as
 * shadow-cron.ts; validation-worker.ts wires the real signature secret, D1 store, and
 * poll/reconcile scheduling (ctx.waitUntil).
 *
 * Event handling is deliberately minimal and observe-only:
 * - Signature verification (github-app.ts verifyWebhookSignature) gates EVERYTHING, ping included -
 *   an unsigned/mis-signed delivery gets 401 and no processing. GitHub's HMAC is the only thing
 *   distinguishing a real delivery from an attacker-forged POST to a public URL.
 * - installation / installation_repositories: enroll the added repositories (source
 *   'github-app-webhook') and remember the installation id - the key that later lets the Worker mint
 *   per-installation read tokens (private-repo ground truth without a PAT).
 * - installation.deleted: erases every repository's analysis records and evidence archives
 *   (shadow-erasure.ts), then marks each REMOVED - the one state transition beyond
 *   VALIDATING->SHADOW_ACTIVE that is NOT a human decision under the Stage 2 spec, because
 *   site/data-handling.html makes it a standing promise ("Uninstalling deletes it") the tenant's own
 *   action must fulfil immediately, not on the next person to look. installation.suspend is different
 *   and deliberately NOT erased: a suspension is reversible by the same tenant, unlike an uninstall.
 * - push to the DEFAULT branch: schedule an immediate shadow poll - the whole point of the webhook
 *   source is predicting closer to the push than a 10-minute cron tick can, which is what makes the
 *   prospectiveness evidence (prediction strictly before CI completion) strong. Non-default refs are
 *   acknowledged and ignored (the poll pipeline observes the default branch). The cron sweep is the
 *   safety net for a lost or refused push (shadow-push-poll.ts, 2026-09-04).
 * - workflow_run completed: schedule reconciliation for that repository - ground truth exactly when
 *   it exists, instead of waiting for the next cron sweep.
 * - pull_request: acknowledged, not yet processed (PR-delta shadow support is a designed-but-not-built
 *   follow-up; silently dropping the event category would hide that gap, so the response says so).
 * - Anything else: 200 "ignored" - GitHub sends many event types; a webhook that 4xxes unhandled
 *   events shows up as a sea of red in the App's delivery log for no reason.
