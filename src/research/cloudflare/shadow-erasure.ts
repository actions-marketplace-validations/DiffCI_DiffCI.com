/**
 * The two deletion commitments site/data-handling.html makes about the Shadow pipeline:
 *
 *   "Uninstalling deletes it. Removing the App from a repository deletes that repository's
 *   analysis records and evidence archives."
 *   "90 days maximum, regardless. Nothing is kept beyond 90 days from the analysis that produced
 *   it, whether or not the App is still installed."
 *
 * Both are orchestrated the same shape: read the R2 evidence keys a set of D1 rows names, delete
 * those R2 objects, THEN delete the D1 rows. That order matters - the R2 key exists nowhere except
 * inside the D1 row that is about to be removed, so reading it after deletion is impossible, and
 * deleting R2 first means a crash between the two steps leaves an orphaned R2 object (wasted space,
 * silently cleaned up by a later sweep once nothing references it) rather than a D1 row that still
 * looks intact while its evidence archive is already gone.
 *
 * This module holds only the two orchestration functions - the D1 queries live on ShadowStore
 * (shadow-store.ts, kept next to every other shadow_* query for the same reason
 * getRepositorySummary lives there) and the R2 batch-delete lives on R2EvidenceStore (r2-store.ts).
 * Both dependencies are the exact interfaces already used everywhere else in this pipeline, so this
 * is unit-testable against the same hand-rolled D1Binding/R2Binding fakes as the rest of the test
 * suite - no live Cloudflare resources required.
