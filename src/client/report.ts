/**
 * The observation report - DiffCI's client-side wire format (Phase 02, 2026-08-26).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every earlier pipeline in this repository analysed OTHER people's repositories on
 * DiffCI's own infrastructure: a container cloned the source, built the graph, and kept the evidence.
 * That shape cannot be installed by a stranger - it asks them to hand a private tree to a service they
 * have not evaluated, before they have seen a single number. Phase 02 inverts it. The analysis runs on
 * the repository's own runner, inside its own CI, against a checkout it already has, and the only thing
 * that ever leaves is this document.
 *
 * So this file is the privacy boundary as much as it is a type. Everything DiffCI could learn about a
 * repository it does not host is a field below, and `payload` states in the document itself what the
 * document contains. If a future field would carry file CONTENT, an environment variable, or anything
 * a `git show` would print, it does not belong here - it belongs in a design conversation first.
 *
 * VERSIONING. `schema` is checked by consumers before anything else is read. A change that removes or
 * repurposes a field is a new version, not an edit to this one: reports are produced by a pinned action
 * inside someone else's CI, and old producers keep sending v1 long after the server has moved on.
