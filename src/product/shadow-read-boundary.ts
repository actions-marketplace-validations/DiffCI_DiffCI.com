 * schema in src/research/cloudflare/schema-migration-2026-08-21-stage2-shadow.sql) - every method here
 * is a SELECT, nothing here ever writes to diffci-research. The Worker wiring (product-worker.ts) binds
 * diffci-research as a SEPARATE, additional D1 binding purely for this boundary; nothing else in the
 * product/billing/usage/runner modules may touch it directly.
 *
 * Chosen approach (Part 20's "smallest safe implementation"): a direct read-only D1Binding to the
 * existing database, not a replicated copy or an internal service call - there is no new infrastructure
 * to stand up, and a read-only SQL binding cannot mutate shadow_predictions/shadow_ground_truth by
 * construction (this module simply never issues an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE against it). A future move to a
 * replicated summary table or an internal service call remains possible without changing this
 * interface's shape.
