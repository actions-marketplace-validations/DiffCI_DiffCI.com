# DiffCI — Current State

**Original snapshot:** 2026-08-21 (live-verified against the deployed Worker and this repo's own CI at
the time of writing) · **CI operations updated:** 2026-09-25
· **Repo:** [github.com/adityankale190895/DiffCI.com](https://github.com/adityankale190895/DiffCI.com)
· **Branch:** `main` @ `b997c6d`, working tree clean

This document is a snapshot, not a design doc. For the full narrative and decision rationale behind any
of this, follow the links in [Reference index](#reference-index) at the bottom — this file exists so you
don't have to read all 31 research reports to know where things stand right now.

## TL;DR

- **What it does today:** given a commit range, DiffCI builds a real TypeScript dependency graph and
  computes a confidence-scored, fallback-aware CI execution plan (what could safely be skipped). It has
  never been wired to actually skip, cancel, or block real CI anywhere — every mode is observe-and-compare.
- **Validation stage:** Stage 0–1B (historical, 2,000+ deltas) are complete — **GO WITH CONDITIONS**.
  Stage 2 (prospective shadow validation on live traffic) is **in progress**, running autonomously
  24/7, verdict **EXTEND SHADOW VALIDATION** (not enough real volume yet for a go/no-go call).
- **Infra:** two Cloudflare Workers (research/shadow pipeline, and a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner
  dispatcher), D1 + R2 for persistence, Cloudflare Sandbox Containers for real git/TypeScript analysis.
  Two separate, least-privilege GitHub Apps.
- **CI health:** authoritative full CI runs on `ubuntu-latest` as of 2026-09-25. The Cloudflare runner
  remains in the separate non-blocking observation workflow for continued dogfooding. This split was
  made after the full suite outgrew the Queue consumer's 15-minute lifetime and GitHub recorded the
  self-hosted runner losing communication during tests.
- **Biggest live gap as of the original writing of this doc** (the autonomous cron's diffci source
  snapshot in R2 stamped `e58fdfb` while `main` had moved 4 commits past it) **is now fixed and
  live-verified** — see [`2026-08-21-shadow-source-integrity-fix.md`](research/2026-08-21-shadow-source-integrity-fix.md)
  and [Known gaps §1](#known-gaps--action-items). The invariant (deployed Worker's expected SHA == R2
  archive SHA == SHA recorded on every new prediction) now holds by construction — a mismatch fails
  closed (STALE/MISSING/UNKNOWN) instead of silently analyzing with old code.

## 1. What DiffCI is

A deterministic, change-aware CI planner. Given a commit or PR:

1. `src/git/` (`analyzeGitDelta`) parses the commit range into a structured `GitDelta`. Invariant: a
   failed analysis returns `{ success: false, error }` explicitly — never a silently-empty affected set,
   because an empty set would read as "safe to skip everything."
2. `src/repo/` builds a real TypeScript-compiler-backed dependency graph (`buildDependencyGraph`) and
   runs `ImpactAnalyzer` to turn the graph + delta into a confidence-scored, fallback-aware impact result.
3. `src/planner/` (`DefaultCIPlanner`) turns that impact result into an `ExecutionPlan` — which
   tasks/tests run, which are skip-candidates, and why.

Everything downstream of this (Stage 0/1 research pipeline, Stage 2 shadow pipeline) exists to measure
whether that plan is *safe* and *worth it* before anything is ever allowed to act on it.

## 2. Origin

Moved out of the `DentalPresence.in` monorepo (previously `diffci/` there) into its own repo on
2026-08-21. `DentalPresence.in` remains DiffCI's original dogfooding target — some code (DentalPresence
PATH baseline/task registry, a few fixture tests) still reflects that origin, but the research and
shadow-validation pipelines are generic and have run against dozens of real third-party repositories.

## 3. Validation history

| Stage | Scope | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 0** | 2,000-delta historical benchmark across 20 real repositories, run through a real Cloudflare orchestrator | **GO WITH CONDITIONS** |
| **Stage 1A** | Forensic root-cause investigation of every Stage 0 UNSAFE-confidence case and historical "unsafe miss" candidate; identified top 3 highest-leverage fixes | (diagnostic — feeds 1B) |
| **Stage 1B** | Implemented the 3 fixes (reachability-aware confidence narrowing, improved historical safety-measurement methodology, tsconfig-scope + package.json-diffing fix); validated live — coverage improved, zero contradicted safety cases; ran a real wall-clock FULL/PATH/DiffCI runtime pilot | Fixes shipped and validated |
| **Stage 2** (current) | Prospective shadow validation on real, currently-arriving CI events — not more historical benchmarking | **EXTEND SHADOW VALIDATION** |

of what's built vs. not.

## 4. Stage 2 — live status (queried directly from the deployed Worker for this document)

Stage 2 moved from "a session has to babysit it" to **fully autonomous** partway through 2026-08-21: a
Cloudflare Cron Trigger (`*/10 * * * *`) polls+reconciles enrolled repositories on its own
(`src/research/cloudflare/shadow-cron.ts`), and a registered, read-only **DiffCI Shadow GitHub App**
delivers push/`workflow_run` webhooks for instant predictions and exactly-on-time reconciliation
(`src/shadow/github-app.ts`, `src/research/cloudflare/shadow-webhook.ts`).

Real numbers, pulled from `GET /v1/shadow/status` at time of writing:

| Repository | State | Predictions | Ground truth reconciled | Discriminative opportunities | Mandatory fallback | Baseline-already-optimal |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `unjs/h3` | SHADOW_ACTIVE | 3 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 |
| `unjs/unstorage` | SHADOW_ACTIVE | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| `unjs/defu` | VALIDATING | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `adityankale190895/DiffCI.com` (self) | SHADOW_ACTIVE | 14 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 8 |
| `adityankale190895/DentalPresence.in` | SHADOW_ACTIVE | 15 | 0 | 6 | 6 | 3 |

**33 total predictions recorded, 0 reconciled to real ground truth yet.** This is expected, not broken:
`GET /v1/shadow/cron-status` shows the cron has run every 10 minutes without error (24 predictions
"still pending" in each of the last several runs) — commits simply haven't had time for their own CI to
finish and be fetched back yet, especially since this repo's own CI only just came online (see §5). Zero
reconciliations means every one of Stage 2's headline questions (prospective recall, unsafe-miss rate,
cost/savings) remains genuinely unmeasured — not a defect, just insufficient elapsed time, exactly as the
final report says.

This repository (`DiffCI.com`) and `DentalPresence.in` shadow-observe **themselves** via the installed
App (installation id `155368612`) — every push to `main` enqueues an immediate poll (Queue consumer,
`shadow-push-poll.ts`), and the 10-minute cron sweep is the safety net. Until 2026-09-04 the push poll
ran inside `ctx.waitUntil` and was killed at 30 s for anything but a tiny repository — DentalPresence.in
went unobserved from 2026-08-27 for 168 commits; see
`docs/research/2026-09-04-shadow-push-poll-lifetime.md`.

**Measurement-integrity caveat (2026-09-05, unfixed):** predictions flow, ground truth does not.
DiffCI.com had no new ground-truth row from 2026-08-23 to 2026-09-05 because the reconciler's
`ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 10` window was permanently occupied by ten `no_matching_workflow` rows
(intermediate commits of multi-commit pushes); 249 newer predictions were never attempted. Fixed
2026-09-05 (fair window + explicit terminal state, research note "Fix 1"); the backlog drains through
the normal cron.
DentalPresence.in's 23 ground-truth rows are contaminated: its instantly-skipped CodeQL run is taken
as "the" CI result before the deploy/test run finishes. Economics are `UNKNOWN` on both because
neither repo has a job whose name contains "test". None of this is selector degradation. Do not read
own-repo recall or savings numbers until the repair sequence in
`docs/research/2026-09-05-shadow-telemetry-measurement-integrity.md` is done and a known cohort has
been re-verified by hand.

## 5. CI / self-hosted runner infrastructure

From 2026-08-21 through 2026-09-24, this repo's own authoritative CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
`npm run check` — typecheck + full test suite) dispatched to `[self-hosted, cloudflare]`: a `workflow_job` webhook
(from a **second**, separate, write-scoped GitHub App — "DiffCI Runner Dispatcher") triggers
`src/research/cloudflare/github-runner-worker.ts`, which spins up a fresh Cloudflare Container
(`ops/github-runner/Dockerfile`, GitHub Actions runner agent 2.336.0) per queued job. The runner
registers, runs the job, deregisters, and self-terminates.

**Operational update 2026-09-25:** the authoritative `CI` workflow now runs on `ubuntu-latest` after
the expanded suite exceeded the Queue consumer's 15-minute lifecycle and the runner lost contact
during the test step. `.github/workflows/diffci-observe.yml` still runs on the Cloudflare fleet as a
non-blocking dogfood job, so runner behavior remains observable without making required validation
depend on it. The measurements below describe the historical self-hosted period.

**Status: REPAIRED and QUALIFIED 2026-09-05 (`293b69c`…`70e3dda`).** Two consecutive fresh commits
(`70e3dda`, `f63d139`) ran on their own pinned runners from queued to terminal with no further push
or other event; queue depth 0 afterwards; full stage trail on `GET runner.diffci.com/lifecycle`.
Down from
2026-09-03T03:38Z: `CI` runs waited 24 h for a runner and were cancelled (36 of them), because the
dispatch ran inside the webhook's `ctx.waitUntil()` (cancelled at ~30 s, no record of the runner's
fate), every runner registered with the same labels (GitHub gave each new runner the oldest queued
job - new work starved by its own backlog), and idle instances held the 5-instance container ceiling.
Now: workflows carry a job-unique label (`diffci-job-<run id>`), dispatch runs from a Queue consumer
with every lifecycle stage recorded in `runner_job_lifecycle` / `runner_job_events` (D1
`diffci-research`), a 5-minute reconciler re-dispatches lost/failed/stale jobs, `sleepAfter` is 3 m,
and `GET runner.diffci.com/lifecycle` (bearer) shows the stage trail. First qualification commit's CI
job ran on its own runner within 40 s of queueing and completed with no further push - see the
research note's "Fix 4". The paragraph below describes the verified steady state before the outage.
Last 10 consecutive `CI` runs on `main` all `success` (as of 2026-09-03T03:25Z).
**Re-measured 2026-09-04** (`scripts/remeasure-own-ci-cost.ts`, real job timings from the GitHub Actions
API, priced against the real `standard-2` Cloudflare Containers shape this runner actually uses):
job wall time 135s–354s (median 147s, mean 185s); job cost $0.0048–$0.0127 (median $0.0053, mean $0.0066) — re-measured 2026-09-03 in the launch audit (previous 2026-09-04 run: 126s–325s, $0.0045–$0.0116).
Materially higher than the original 2026-08-21 figures (~1m3s, ~$0.004) because the test suite has grown
roughly 4x since (286 → 384 suites) - not a regression in the runner itself. Zero GitHub Actions compute
billed. Getting here required fixing six
real, distinct bugs in sequence (all in commit history 2026-08-20/21): a missing `User-Agent` header that
403'd every Worker→GitHub API call, a CRLF-mangled `entrypoint.sh` shebang, missing `libicu74`/`libssl3`
on Ubuntu 24.04, a 15-releases-stale runner agent, a container `sleepAfter` killing idle containers
mid-queue-wait, and — the one that actually blocked steady state — every Cloudflare Container reporting
`HOSTNAME=cloudchamber`, so runner names collided and each new registration silently killed the previous
one's connection.

**Why this exists at all:** this GitHub account's own Actions billing is/was blocked ("recent account
payments have failed"), independent of anything in this codebase. Rather than wait on that, DiffCI's own
CI (and its own shadow ground truth) now runs entirely on Cloudflare credits.

Two GitHub Apps exist and are **deliberately never merged**:

| App | Permissions | Installable by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DiffCI** | Read-only: Metadata, Contents, Actions, Checks. Unified repository discovery, installation lifecycle, push observation, and workflow reconciliation. | Design partners + own repos | **Unified manifest ready; migrate legacy DiffCI Shadow installations before uninstalling the old App** (`docs/github-app-consolidation.md`) |
| **DiffCI Runner Dispatcher** | `Administration:write`, `Actions:write` | Own repos only (DiffCI.com, DentalPresence.in) | **Registered, live** (`docs/github-app-registration-runner.md`) |

## 6. Build/test health (verified for this document)

```
npm run typecheck   → clean, no errors
npm run test        → 336 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (74 suites) — 34 new tests from the source-integrity fix
```

Working tree is clean; `main` is up to date with `origin/main`.

## 7. Known gaps / action items

1. ~~Cron is polling a stale source snapshot~~ — **fixed and live-verified**
   ([`2026-08-21-shadow-source-integrity-fix.md`](research/2026-08-21-shadow-source-integrity-fix.md)).
   `GET /v1/shadow/cron-status`'s `sourceIntegrity` now reports `status: "CURRENT"` with `expectedSha`,
   `archiveSha`, and this repo's real HEAD (`b997c6d...`) all equal — confirmed by directly querying the
   deployed Worker after running the new `npm run shadow:deploy` pipeline. A live self-observed
   prediction (via the DiffCI Shadow App's push webhook, triggered by this fix's own commits) recorded a
   real, non-null `engine_source_sha`, proving the field flows through end-to-end, not just in unit
   tests. Any future drift between the deployed Worker's expected SHA and the R2 archive now fails
   closed (`STALE`/`MISSING`/`UNKNOWN`) and blocks autonomous analysis rather than silently using old
   code — this class of bug cannot recur silently.
2. **Zero ground-truth reconciliations across all 5 enrolled repositories.** Every headline Stage 2
   metric (prospective recall, unsafe-miss rate, fallback rate at scale, cost/savings) is still an empty
   denominator. This should resolve itself now that own-repo CI is real and green — but hasn't yet as of
   this writing.
3. ~~`docs/github-app-registration-runner.md` is stale~~ — **fixed**: its status banner now reflects
   registration + verified green CI (see §5).
4. **No `DISCRIMINATIVE_OPPORTUNITY` prediction has been ground-truthed yet** — the category that
   actually exercises DiffCI's selective-skipping logic. 4 have been predicted (1 on `unstorage`, 3 on
   this repo) but none reconciled.
5. **No real design-partner repositories** — Gates B (1 partner), C (3 repos), D (5-10 repos) all
   explicitly need actual external stakeholders, which this project does not have yet. Cannot be
   substituted with more public repos.
6. **No dashboard/customer-facing UI, no dollar-cost economics** — `/v1/shadow/status` returns raw JSON
   only; no UI. Blocked on real reconciled volume, not effort.
7. **`DentalPresence.in`'s own workflows** reportedly still target `ubuntu-latest` (billing-blocked) per
   project memory as of this writing — not independently re-verified in this session since it's a
   separate repository; switching them to `[self-hosted, cloudflare]` (same pattern as this repo's
   `ci.yml`) would put its CI on Cloudflare too and unblock its own shadow ground truth.
   *2026-09-05:* re-verified — they run on GitHub-hosted runners (`Actions Linux` minutes billed to
   DentalPresence.in: 2094 in August, 957 in the first four days of September).
8. **Shadow measurement integrity (2026-09-05, open).** Four distinct defects, all in measurement,
   none in selection — see `research/2026-09-05-shadow-telemetry-measurement-integrity.md`. Agreed
   repair order: (1) ~~terminalise permanent `no_matching_workflow` rows with an explicit reason so the
   reconciler window is never head-of-line blocked~~ — **done 2026-09-05** (fair pending window +
   `reconcile_terminal_*` columns, decided on positive evidence only; see the note's "Fix 1"); (2) ~~require an explicitly identified evidence
   workflow per repository instead of "first non-shadow run to complete"~~ — **done 2026-09-05**
   (`evidence_workflow_paths` via `/v1/shadow/evidence-workflow`, execution-outcome classification,
   `evidence_validity` on every ground-truth row; DentalPresence.in's 26 legacy rows and 77 of
   DiffCI.com's are labelled `CONTAMINATED_WORKFLOW_IDENTITY`, kept, never counted; the six corpus
   repositories are held as `evidence_workflow_unconfigured` until the founder picks their evidence
   workflow — see the note's "Fix 2"); (3) ~~replace substring stage classification with explicit
   repository configuration plus conservative inference~~ — **done 2026-09-05** (`dd4b056`:
   `shadow_stage_economics` written from VERIFIED evidence and the evidence run's own jobs only,
   explicit job/step rules via `/v1/shadow/stage-classification`, inseparable work measured but never
   estimated; legacy economics table labelled `LEGACY_UNVERIFIED` and unscheduled; reports read the
   new table only; own CI split into named Typecheck/Test steps in `48ffc53`); (4) repair the runner
   separately (§5). Then run a small known cohort end-to-end and verify D1/R2 by hand before the Stage
   2F clock restarts. ~~Add telemetry self-health invariants~~ — **first set live** on
   `/v1/shadow/cron-status` → `selfHealth` (never-attempted backlog + age, unlabelled ground truth,
   verified rows awaiting stage economics, unconfigured / unverified repositories).
   **Freeze (2026-09-05):** step 1 CLOSED @ `b163a83`, step 2 CLOSED @ `54122be`, step 3 CLOSED @
   `8d0f365`, step 4 CLOSED @ `70e3dda` (qualified by two consecutive fresh commits progressing
   queued → assigned → executing → terminal on their own runners, no further push, full per-stage
   provenance), all production-verified. Economics statement: test-stage work is measured and
   correctly classified; avoidable test-stage work is UNKNOWN where execution is inseparable and
   ESTIMATED (potential, not validated, not billable) only on the separable split-step runs - the
   first such row is commit `70e3dda`.
   **Customer-facing boundaries repaired 2026-09-05 (`e29d1fc`, `140e4db`, both Workers deployed):**
   the public report and the dashboard read admitted stage economics and VERIFIED-only safety; a
   repository with no identified evidence workflow shows an explicit "awaiting CI evidence workflow
   identification" state (predictions may exist, ground truth and savings evidence do not; zero
   observations is not zero opportunity); the dashboard's savings figures are labelled
   `count_based_projection` with a notice. See the note's "Fix 5".
   **Seamless install (2026-09-05, `25dbbe6`…`58b7282`, all Workers deployed):** the evidence workflow
   and stage layout are identified automatically and mechanically from the repository's own workflow
   files and package.json scripts, with the derivation persisted and verified against the first
   executed run before any economics row; every non-observing condition is an explicit report state;
   private repositories' reports need a token shown only on the signed-in dashboard (app.diffci.com);
   per-repository and corpus budget caps; http/www redirects and a contact inbox on the site. Whole
   research corpus identified automatically (each `ci.yml`, by mechanism). No per-install founder
   action remains. The GitHub App Setup URL was set to diffci.com/welcome by the founder on 2026-09-05
   (verified: the welcome page answers 200 with GitHub's installation_id/setup_action parameters).
   See the note's "Fix 6". Private-repository reports: GitHub OAuth sign-in configured by the founder,
   dashboard lists report links authorised by GitHub's collaborator answer (research route
   /v1/shadow/report-access over a Service Binding); founder confirmed end to end on 2026-09-05
   (signed in, both private reports visible with working links); OAuth values validated before use
   (05f5dbe) after a Ctrl-V paste mishap. See the note's Fix 6 addendum.
   **Founder decisions on record:** steps 1 and 2 CLOSED / PRODUCTION-VERIFIED at `54122be`; the six
   corpus repositories stay unconfigured until mechanically verified (never "ci.yml by name"); the 77
   contaminated DiffCI.com rows stay immutable and excluded (a retrospective dataset, if ever wanted,
   is separate and marked); the migration/deploy mixed-version window is an operational finding.
9. **Stage 2F daily observation routine is gone.** `trig_01AZTyUSfZcHtMMxvaKMAFoC` returns 404; the
   observation log has only Day 1 and Day 3 entries. Gate E is not satisfied by elapsed time.

## 8. Architecture map

```
src/git/       Git delta analysis → structured GitDelta (fail-closed by design)
src/repo/      TS-compiler-backed dependency graph + ImpactAnalyzer (confidence-scored impact)
src/planner/   Impact result → ExecutionPlan (DefaultCIPlanner); DentalPresence-specific PATH
               baseline/task registry lives here too (origin artifact, not generic)
src/cache/     Graph caching
src/research/  Stage 0/1 historical benchmark pipeline: repo sampling, generic PATH baseline,
               opportunity classifier, historical GitHub CI evidence + flakiness detection,
               and the Cloudflare orchestrator (src/research/cloudflare/) that runs it at scale
src/shadow/    Stage 2 prospective pipeline: event identity, failure classification,
               ground-truth reconciliation (reconcile.ts), GitHub App JWT/webhook code
               (github-app.ts) — registered and live, see §5
```

**Cloudflare deployment (two Workers, deliberately separate):**

- `diffci-research-sandbox` (`wrangler.research-sandbox.jsonc`) — the Stage 0/1/2 research + shadow
  pipeline. D1 (`diffci-research`), R2 (`diffci-research-evidence`), Sandbox Containers
  (`cloudflare/sandbox:0.12.5`, real git clone + TypeScript compiler), Cron Trigger every 10 minutes.
- `diffci-github-runner` (`wrangler.github-runner.jsonc`) — the ephemeral self-hosted Actions runner
  dispatcher. Durable Object–backed container class (`GithubRunner`), `max_instances: 5`, triggered by
  `workflow_job` webhooks from the separate Runner Dispatcher App.

## 9. Security model (Stage 2 shadow pipeline)

- Every `/v1/shadow/*` route requires the same constant-time Bearer-token check as every other route on
  the research Worker.
- `owner`/`name`/`language` are validated against a strict allow-list before reaching any shell command
  inside a Container.
- Webhook payloads are verified by HMAC-SHA256 before any processing (`verifyWebhookSignature`).
- Shadow mode is read-only end-to-end — clone and analyze, never write, never comment, never label,
  never check out a branch for writing.
- Tenant isolation today is by-value only (every D1 row/R2 key is repository-scoped) — no cross-repo
  query path exists, but there's also no row-level access control tied to installation identity yet.
  Flagged as a real gap for Gate B+ (multi-tenant), not silently assumed solved.

## 10. Commands

```bash
npm run check                    # typecheck + full test suite
npm run diffci / npm run impact  # generate a delta/impact/plan for this repo's latest commit
npm run research:stage0          # real Stage 0-style historical benchmark, locally
npm run shadow:deploy            # CANONICAL: typecheck+test, deploy the research/shadow Worker, upload
                                  # the source archive tagged with real HEAD, verify source integrity is
                                  # CURRENT before exiting 0 - use this, not the two commands below, for
                                  # any change to src/ that should be live in autonomous shadow polling
npm run research:sandbox:deploy  # low-level: deploy the research/shadow Worker only (no source upload/verify)
npm run shadow:upload-source     # low-level: re-upload the diffci source tarball only (no Worker deploy)
npm run github-runner:deploy     # deploy the self-hosted-runner dispatcher Worker
